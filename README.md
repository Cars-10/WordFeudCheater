WordFeudCheater
===============
This work is based on the excellent and efficient scrabble solver from https://github.com/astralcai/scrabbler/tree/master.

WordFeud is a scrabble game for your mobile. My Fiance has been killing me in almost every game.  What's a hacker to do but write some code that can make it a more even fight!


WordFeudCheater will propose the next move in a wordfeud.  It does this using OCR to indetify the tiles placed on the board and in the rack. Simply take a screen shot and Airdrop to your Mac.  The code checks for new screenshots every 10 seconds and when found will propose several next moves.
